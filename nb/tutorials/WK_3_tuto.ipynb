We can assume that the observations are independent therefore the joint probability is calculated by the product of all individual ones.* *The product of many small number will produced 'numerical problems' in the computations, rounding errors because of the limitations. A way to mitigate the issue is to transform the product into a sum of larger numbers by taking the logarithm. We can use the logarithm to do maximum likelihood because the logarithm does not change which input value produces the maximum.*\n",

This technique is so commo that we often tlak about log likelihoods."

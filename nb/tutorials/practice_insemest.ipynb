Demonstrates knowledge of the topic, explaining nuances/ alternatives. Then it will degrade from 40% it is fails to achieve that.\n",

        "* You will have **90 minutes** to do the exam,  plus 15 minutes to upload. This is an **important point**, try to become familiar with the functions to run biogeme, pandas, numpy... Even if you have full access to the material of the course and can look at online programming forums for python issues, it might take some extra time. You can also prepare you own auxiliary functions to reduce the verbosity of biogeme. We will see this in the practice notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **The questions will be very similar to what you will see in this practice notebook.** The point of the exam is to prove that you can do a basic analysis with a multinomial logit and use biogeme as a tool. The differenciation will come mostly in the type of data, what variables are involved and the 'what-if scenarios' questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The answers should be technically correct, but **the explanation in the text cells should demonstrate knowledge** of what you are doing. Why did you make that decision?. For example, a variable transformation, why do you choose that particular one? Why do you choose to add that variable to the model? What do you think it is going to do? After the results: Are the results as expected? Please do not be afraid of being 'too obvious' when explaining something.\n",
        "When explaining coefficients, Do these have the expected sign, what is the interpretation with respect to the reference alternative?\n",
        " A perfect code but no explanation will net you 50-60% of the marks. The opposite example, if you get stuck with a python issue but know 'conceptually' how to answer, writing a good text explanation and some pseudocode will potentially net you up to half marks.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* There will be no data cleaning involved, and the dataset will have full availability, you can create a full availability dictionary to pass to biogeme by just setting all entries to 1. ` av = {1:1, 2:1, 3:1, ...}`. We will see this in the practice.\n",

        "* Please **do not to identify yourself explicitly in the anwers**, writing your name or student id. Besides that, you are free to express yourself.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The 'visual appearance' part of the exam stands for a small percentage of the mark, 10%. Try to clarify, do not leave very large code cells followed/ preceded by large text cells, try to interleave them so it is more natural to follow. Section you answers if they become long or address different topics. Do not write very long outputs, for example do not print the full dataset. It is critical that the main part of each answer is cleary identified with its own text cell and code cell. The bad example would be a large text cell explaining all the steps and the a large code cell that prints the output, with the answers in the middle of the code. Of course, if your answer does not require code (it might happen) do not force a code chunk in. The way we will mark the visual part is to read the notebook and if something stands out in a negative sense, this subtracts points.\n",

We know perfectly well the loudness of each sound, we have a physical definition, we can even control it with a computer. But even then, the indivudal sometimes fails at identifying the louder noise. The idea then is that the level of stimilus plus a random component.\n",

Basically, the intensity of the stimulus is the utility, and then there is random component. In choice modelling, this metaphore is helpful, but it is not that appropriate because we lack a proper measurement of the level of the stimulus. Since we do not know how to measure utility, we the analysts, define what is the level of the stimulus according to our subjective idea by choosing the function $f$ and the variables that we measure. So use this metaphor if you find it helpful, but please be aware of the limitations.\n",

For example depending on the function that we choose for the model, we could get different values for $V_{nj}$ and $\\varepsilon_{nj}$. We could get to the same utility with different decompositions, there are many ways to decompose the utility, all getting to the same results. In other words, so far this decomposition is so general that it is not saying anything too useful. When we, the analysts, impose some restrictions on the functions or even on how the random component (such as a specific distribution), *then* we would be saying something. **In fact the 'name of the game' in choice modelling is making these decisions, selecting restriction on the functions and random components gets us to any of the major models that we are going to study in this course, and the ones that are more applied in practice.**\n",

By combining these correctly we can get to any of the 'latte', 'expresso', 'long black' choice set.

In the coffee example, the tradition or natural way is to separate the types of coffee into different alternatives (we talk about latte, long black and expresso, not about coffee with $x$ ml of milk, $y$ ml of water). In discrete choice experiments, the researcher defines which are the alternatives, thinking about how they will be presented to the participants. There are technical issues with the number of alternatives, if everything is an alternative, the number of alternatives can get too big, complicating the interpretation and predictive capabilities of the model. For example, when we have many optionals for our coffee: size, sugar, extra flavours on top, ice the numbers of alternatives grows exponentially, we can soon get in the scenario of more alternatives that observations in out experiment. Modelling everything as an alternative will make interpretation difficult, for example to recover the effect of size, we will not get a simple mathematical relationship, we will get a different utility function per size.\n",

Approximately, there is a 72% chance that they will choose latte, a 16.7% chance that they will choose long black, and the remaining that they will be indifferent according to the utility.
